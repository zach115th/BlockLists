# Emerging Threats Blocklists

This directory contains **time-bound blocklists** for rapidly evolving or newly discovered threats.

Unlike the more “stable” lists (e.g., long-lived C2 infrastructure or ASN-derived IP ranges), the entries here are:

- **Tied to specific campaigns, malware families, or zero-day events**
- **Expected to churn quickly** as infrastructure is burned and replaced
- Intended to be **high-signal enrichment** for defenders who are actively responding or hunting

> ⚠️ **Important:** These lists are for defensive and research use only.  
> Inclusion of an IP, domain, or other IoC **does not** imply that every service behind it is malicious or that the owner is complicit. Treat these as **strong context, not verdicts.**
