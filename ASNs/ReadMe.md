# ASN-Derived IP Blocklists

This directory contains **IP blocklists derived from specific ASNs** that:

- Operate as **bulletproof hosting providers**, and/or  
- Are known to **accept cryptocurrency as a primary/anonymous payment method** for hosting or related services.

In other words: the **selection criteria** is ASN-based, but the actual contents of these files are **IP addresses** that fall within those ASNs.

> ⚠️ **Important:** These lists are for security research and defensive use only.  
> Inclusion of an IP address **does not** imply that the ASN’s operator or all of its customers are malicious. Many of these networks host a mix of legitimate and abusive activity.

## Structure

Each file in this directory represents a logically grouped set of IPs sourced from one or more ASNs. Common patterns include:

- **By ASN group or provider type** – e.g., bulletproof-focused providers, crypto/VPS-heavy providers, or both.
- **By use case / aggressiveness** – e.g., “high risk,” “heavily abused,” or more conservative lists.
- **By data source or campaign** – if/when you break things out by specific investigations or intel sources.

Check the filenames and any header comments for details on how a given file is scoped.
